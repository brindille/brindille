No framework boilerplate
========================

Boilerplate for single page website without using framework.

TODO
====
- Routing
    - Display correct view in function of route
    - Take care of route params in view
- Templating (maybe use Handlebar or an other)
    - easily append view template such as `<div data-template="my-template"></div>`
    - bind data such as `<h1>{{ title }}</h1>`
- Component building
    - easily register component in view
    - use component template inside a view
    - data binding
    - events handlers
    - maybe give some parameters by the parent view
